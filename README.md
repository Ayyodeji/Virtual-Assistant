# Virtual Assistant

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing a Virtual Assistant. The Virtual Assistant is capable of performing various tasks, such as answering questions, providing the current time, searching the web, playing music, opening applications, and more. The project utilizes speech recognition and text-to-speech conversion to interact with the user.

## Project Overview

The Virtual Assistant Jupyter Notebook explores the functionalities of a virtual assistant. It utilizes the `speech_recognition` library to listen for voice commands, processes the commands using natural language processing techniques, and responds to the user through text-to-speech conversion. The assistant can perform tasks like providing the time, searching the web, playing music, opening applications, and more.
